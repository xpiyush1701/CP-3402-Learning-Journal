# CP3402 Learning Journal

## Learning Processes and Self-Reflection

### Week 1


### Learning Activities & Resources
This week I created an interior designing website using HTML and CSS through the assistance of resources including LinkedIn Learning and Youtube videos. These helped me create a sticky navigation bar and a stylesheet that can be used across multiple website design and development.

### Estimated Hours
I spent about 1.5 hours of learning the fundamentals required to create a well-designed static website.

### Content Insights
The creation of an interior design website was a great way to revise old learnings from my first year of university. I had to conduct research on how to create a sticky navigation bar even though I did not use it as I prefered the user to scroll through the page instead of clicking buttons. Additionally, I had peer-assistance with uploading my files onto Github, further allowing me to find the link of my website and further evaluate this weeks work in my journal. These simple and recent learning processes were needed as a refresher that I will be implementing for the next practicals.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Completing the practicals inspired me to watch more guides on creating well-structured websites that look 'professional' as I feel like getting into the habit of creating good websites could get me more confident in my abilites without constant researh. This would allow for me to use my well-produced websites as a template guide for future and upcoming tasks. I feel like my interest in improving my website layout will allow for less work on the aesthetic and more work on the content, aiming towards a goal-driven website.
